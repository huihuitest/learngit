小结：


    在GitHub上，可以任意Fork开源仓库；

    自己拥有Fork后的仓库的读写权限；

    可以推送pull request给官方仓库来贡献代码。

	如何解决failed to push some refs to git：
	出现错误的主要原因是github中的README.md文件不在本地代码目录中
	可以通过如下命令进行代码合并【注：pull=fetch+merge]
	git pull --rebase origin master    // 合并gitee
	git pull --rebase github master    // 合并github
	再执行语句 git push -u origin master即可完成代码上传到gitee
	再执行语句 git push -u github master即可完成代码上传到github
